## **ABRF 2018 Workshop**

### **The Galaxy Platform as an Accessible, Core Laboratory Solution for Proteogenomic Analysis and Informatics**
Sunday, April 22, 2018 (8:00am-12:00pm) 
<br>

_**Organizer**: Pratik Jagtap, University of Minnesota_

_**Instructors:**  Tim Griffin, Pratik Jagtap and Praveen Kumar_

**Target Audience**: _Core directors, personnel, data scientists and researchers interested in proteomics, multi-omics and microbiome research. Previous experience with Galaxy or other informatics solutions is not necessary_.


**_Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop computer to participate._**
<br>

**Workshop goals:**

- Introduce the Galaxy framework as a solution for data analysis across ‘omics’ domains
- Provide hands-on experience to attendees in using Galaxy
- Demonstrate use of Galaxy for a proteogenomic analysis (RNA-seq and proteomic integrative analysis)
- Lay the foundation for attendees to implement Galaxy at their own facility or institution to meet ‘omics’ data analysis needs (either specific to one domain or for multi-omics)
